/// `@MainActor` because the only writer is the main-actor `EmojiPickerController` at commit time, and
/// reads are cheap snapshots taken between keystrokes. State is stored as a single JSON blob so the
/// read/write is atomic and avoids per-key dictionary bridging quirks.

/// The `deinit` is `nonisolated` to dodge a macOS 14 Swift bug: an isolated deinit on a `@MainActor`
/// class with non-trivial stored properties routes through `swift_task_deinitOnExecutorMainActorBackDeploy`,
/// which over-releases and aborts the process ("pointer being freed was not allocated") when an
/// instance is destroyed — it crashed the app-hosted unit tests deterministically. Releasing the
/// stored UserDefaults reference plus value types is thread-safe and needs no main-actor hop.
