/// Adapts Cotabby's shared suggestion request into the prompting style that works best with Apple's
/// Foundation Models framework.
///
/// Why this file exists:
/// llama.cpp and Apple's on-device model accept the same high-level task, but they respond best
/// to different prompt shapes. The local llama runtime consumes one prompt string directly, while
/// Foundation Models gives us a first-class instructions channel. Keeping that translation here
/// prevents Apple-specific prompt policy from leaking back into `SuggestionCoordinator` or the
/// shared request factory.
