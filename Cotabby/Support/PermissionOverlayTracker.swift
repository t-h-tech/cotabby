/// Pure decision rule for the guided-permission helper overlay that floats over System Settings.
///
/// `PermissionGuidanceController` re-evaluates the overlay very often — a short repeating timer plus
/// an app-activation observer — so "what should the overlay do now?" must collapse to a no-op
/// whenever nothing actually changed. The previous controller logic hid the overlay and re-ordered
/// the window on *every* tick, so the helper flickered as focus bounced between System Settings, the
/// macOS permission dialog, and Cotabby's own windows. Keeping the rule pure makes the no-op paths
/// cheap to test.
