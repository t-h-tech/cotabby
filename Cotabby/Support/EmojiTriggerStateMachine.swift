/// because they depend on the matcher; the machine is told the current match count when it needs it.
/// Given the same inputs it always produces the same transitions, so it is fully unit testable
/// without Accessibility, CGEvent, or UI.
///
/// Deliberate divergence from EMOJI.md §2.3: ordinary query characters are NOT consumed. They flow
/// into the focused field and the controller reads the authoritative text from Accessibility at
/// commit time. This keeps the active, gating event tap out of the ordinary-typing path (the
/// issue #328 invariant that the base branch fixed) while still consuming navigation, commit, and
/// Escape keys so the picker can be driven without the foreground app seeing them.
