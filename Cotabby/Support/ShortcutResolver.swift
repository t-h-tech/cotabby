/// File overview:
/// Pure, event-time resolution of which `(keyCode, modifiers)` pair should be treated as the
/// accept-word (or accept-full) shortcut for the currently-focused app.
///
/// **Precedence (highest first):**
/// 1. **Terminal-specific binding** — applied by the input monitor's existing terminal-aware
///    closures (it knows the snapshot is a shell-integration session).
/// 2. **Per-app override** — `PerAppShortcutOverride` matching the frontmost bundle id.
/// 3. **Global binding** — `SuggestionSettingsModel.acceptanceKey*` /
///    `SuggestionSettingsModel.fullAcceptanceKey*`.
///
/// This file is the single source of truth for that ordering. The resolver is intentionally a
/// pure free function (no event tap, no AX) so the matrix can be unit-tested without launching
/// the app — the input-monitor providers in `CotabbyAppEnvironment` call into it once per
/// keystroke with the current frontmost bundle id from `FocusTrackingModel.snapshot`.
///
/// The resolver does **not** handle the terminal precedence: callers detect a live shell session
/// first and short-circuit before consulting per-app overrides. Per-app overrides are intended
/// for normal AX surfaces; terminal acceptance has its own dedicated binding because the
/// shell-hook path has stricter pass-through requirements (the keystroke must reach the shell's
/// zle widget).
