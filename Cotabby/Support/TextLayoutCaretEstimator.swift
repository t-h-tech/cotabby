/// Estimates caret geometry from a hidden TextKit layout of the text before the caret, anchored
/// to the field's frame. Used when the host's AX caret geometry is unusable (`.estimated`: only
/// `AXFrame` is available) or demonstrably wrong (a `.derived` rect that disagrees with the text
/// layout by a full line — Gmail-class editors whose child-run mapping drifts across blank lines).
///
/// The layout itself is generalized on purpose — no per-app metrics tables — but it is calibrated
/// with whatever the host actually reveals about its own rendering:
///   - `observedLineHeight` (the AX caret rect's height, a real rendered line box) replaces the
///     font's natural line height. Web hosts commonly render with CSS line-height well above the
///     font metrics, and that error compounds per line: six lines at two-thirds height put the
///     ghost two full lines too high.
///   - `observedCharWidth` (measured from child text-run frames) rescales the approximated font so
///     soft-wrap points match the host's. A too-narrow font wraps too late, losing whole lines.
///   - `observedContentEdges` (leftmost/topmost child-run edges) replace the guessed content
///     insets, since `AXFrame` includes padding that AX never reports directly.
///
/// Deliberately conservative: any condition under which the hidden layout could lie about the real
/// field (truncated context window, possibly-scrolled content, tab stops, unusable frame) rejects
/// the estimate and the caller keeps the existing fallback behavior. Runs at presentation time
/// only, never inside the focus-poll hot path, so it adds no per-keystroke AX or layout cost while
/// no suggestion is being shown.
