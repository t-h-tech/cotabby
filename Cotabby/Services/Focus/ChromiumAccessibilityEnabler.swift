/// Wakes the dormant web-accessibility tree of Chromium-family browsers and allowlisted Electron
/// editors so their web text becomes readable.

/// Chromium and Electron build their web accessibility tree lazily: it stays asleep until an
/// assistive-technology client signals interest by setting `AXManualAccessibility` on the
/// application. Without this, a Chrome renderer reports itself AX-unaware and the system-wide
/// focus query keeps returning the omnibox (or nil) no matter where the user clicks in the page.
///
/// Priming is set on the **browser process** element, never on renderer subprocesses (which have
/// no OS-level AX element); the browser owns the composed tree and fans the request out to
/// renderers over IPC. New tabs/renderers spawned after Cotabby launches are covered because the
/// browser rebuilds the tree on demand once primed.
///
/// `@MainActor` because all AX calls must run on the main thread, matching `FocusTracker`.
