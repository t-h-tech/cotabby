/// it: the two interactions are orthogonal (ghost-text prediction vs. a selectable emoji panel), and
/// keeping them separate stops the suggestion state machine from growing emoji concerns.
///
/// Data flow:
/// - `observe(_:)` receives every keystroke (via `SuggestionCoordinator.emojiInputObserver`) and feeds
///   the pure `EmojiTriggerStateMachine`. It records the per-key consume decision for the decider.
/// - `decideCaptureKey(_:)` is the closure the active tap consults to swallow navigation/commit/Escape
///   keys. It returns the decision `observe(_:)` just computed for the same event.
/// - Focus snapshots reposition the panel as the caret moves and cancel capture on focus change.
/// - On commit, the literal `:query` run is measured from Accessibility and replaced with the glyph.
