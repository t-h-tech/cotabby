## What It Does

Cotabby brings AI autocomplete to the text fields you already use on macOS. It works system-wide, stays out of your way, and shows suggestions as ghost text beside your cursor. Press `Tab` to accept a word, keep pressing to take more, or keep typing to ignore it.

It also includes inline emoji autocomplete: type `:smile`, `:tada`, or `:+1` and pick the emoji without leaving your current app.

Everything runs on-device. No hosted API, no cloud round-trip.

## Features

- **System-wide completions** -- Works in any macOS text field (Safari, Notes, Mail, etc.)
- **Ghost text UI** -- Suggestions appear as translucent overlay text at your cursor
- **Inline emoji autocomplete** -- Type `:emoji:`-style shortcuts and insert the selected emoji without leaving your current app
- **100% local** -- AI inference and emoji matching run on-device
- **Visual context** -- Screenshot OCR gives the model awareness of what's on screen
- **Low latency** -- Optimized for fast response on Apple Silicon

## Engines

**Apple Intelligence**: uses Apple's on-device `FoundationModels` runtime on macOS 26 or later, no download required.

**Open Source**: runs local GGUF *base* models in-process through llama.cpp via `CotabbyInference`. Rather than instructing an instruction-tuned model, Cotabby treats the model as a pure text continuer and conditions it on your persona, style, language, and on-screen context. Cotabby ships with four built-in downloadable models:

| Model          | File                             | Size    | Source                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tabby-2-nano` | `Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base.i1-Q6_K.gguf` | ~0.8 GB | [mradermacher/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base-i1-GGUF) |
| `tabby-2-mini` | `Qwen3.5-2B-Base.i1-Q4_K_M.gguf` | ~1.4 GB | [mradermacher/Qwen3.5-2B-Base-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Qwen3.5-2B-Base-i1-GGUF)     |
| `tabby-2-base` | `gemma-4-E2B.i1-Q6_K.gguf`       | ~4.5 GB | [mradermacher/gemma-4-E2B-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/gemma-4-E2B-i1-GGUF)             |
| `tabby-2-pro`  | `gemma-4-E4B.i1-Q4_K_M.gguf`     | ~5.0 GB | [mradermacher/gemma-4-E4B-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/gemma-4-E4B-i1-GGUF)             |

`tabby-2-base` (Gemma E2B) is the default and the recommended onboarding tier; `tabby-2-nano` is the lightweight option for low-memory Macs, `tabby-2-mini` is a smaller alternative, and `tabby-2-pro` is the largest. Apple Intelligence remains instruction-tuned and is unaffected by the base-model path.

### Bring your own model

Any GGUF small enough to run on-device works. Drop a `.gguf` file into Cotabby's models folder and refresh the model list from the menu bar.

Browse the [unsloth GGUF collection on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/unsloth) for more variants. Smaller quants (`Q3_K_M`, `Q4_K_S`) trade quality for size; larger models give better completions at the cost of memory and per-token latency.

## Install

**Compatibility:** Requires macOS 15.0 or later. Apple Intelligence suggestions require macOS 26 or later; on earlier supported systems, use the Open Source engine.

### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap FuJacob/cotabby
brew install --cask cotabby
```

Upgrade later with `brew upgrade --cask cotabby`. The tap repo is [FuJacob/homebrew-cotabby](https://github.com/FuJacob/homebrew-cotabby).

### Manual download

Download and install the latest release from [cotabby.app](https://cotabby.app).

### Why those permissions?

- **Accessibility**: read the focused text field's value and caret position.
- **Input Monitoring**: detect global `Tab` presses, acceptance shortcuts, and inline emoji triggers.
- **Screen Recording**: capture a screenshot around the focused field for visual context (OCR).

## Local Development

Requires Xcode and Command Line Tools. Apple Silicon is strongly recommended for local model performance. For setup, build, test, and contribution workflow details, start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FuJacob/cotabby.git Cotabby
cd Cotabby
open Cotabby.xcodeproj
```

If you want to understand the runtime and suggestion pipeline before contributing, read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
